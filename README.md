## Author: Sylvester Assiamah - Module 12 

## Description
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). This is a command-line application to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, Inquirer, and PostgreSQL.
